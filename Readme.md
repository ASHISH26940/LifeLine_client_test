# Lifeline
 
 Lifeline

Welcome to the Lifeline, a website designed to help individuals find information about the availability of blood in their region.We have created a Plasmabot which will guide our user to find there repective blood type. This platform serves as a centralized hub for users to search and access real-time data on blood availability, making it easier for both donors and recipients to connect.

Techstack Used 
---------------

- **Backend**
    - Spring - A comprehensive framework for enterprise Java development.

- **Frontend**
    - React - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Vite - A fast build tool for modern JavaScript projects.

- **Database**
    - MongoDb - A non-relational database management system.

- **Container**
    - Docker - An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

------------------


Features
---------------

- **Login**
    - Local Authentication using Email and Password
    - OAuth 2.0 Authentication: Sign in with Google

- **Chatbot**

- **API**
    - Spring Api - Containing data about the available blood availability in the hospital across the West Bengal.  
    - Open Street Api - Presents us with the map

Prerequisites
---------------

- MongoDb (local install OR hosted)
    - Local Install: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - Hosted: No need to install, see the MongoDB Atlas section

    - Node.js (Preferably 18+)

    - Command Line Tools

    - Any IDE

Getting Started
---------------

**Step 1:** The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Go to the client folder
cd ./myproject/client-side

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Go to the server folder
cd ./myproject/server-side

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app(client)
npm run dev

# Then simply start your app server(server)
nodemon ./index.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run `sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

**Step 2:** Obtain API Keys and change configs if needed
After completing step 1 and locally installing MongoDB, you should be able to access the application through a web browser and use local user accounts. However, certain functions like API integrations may not function correctly until you obtain specific keys from service providers. The keys provided in the project serve as placeholders, and you can retain them for features you are not currently utilizing. To incorporate the acquired keys into the application, you have two options:
   
1.  Set environment variables in your console session: Alternatively, you can set the keys as environment variables directly through the command prompt. For instance, in bash, you can use the `export` command like this: `export FACEBOOK_SECRET=xxxxxx`. This method is considered a better practice as it reduces the risk of accidentally including your secrets in a code repository.
2. Replace the keys in the `.env.example` file: Open the `.env.example` file and update the placeholder keys with the newly acquired ones. This method has the risk of accidental checking-in of your secrets to code repos.

**Note:** There is no preference for how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

ü§ñ Bots
--------

### Plasma Bot
- Our one and only bot which simplifies the whole process of finding availability,donation,receive of blood supply. It not only provides the location on the map , it also find nearest hospital nearby you then find the shortest distance between you and hospital.

Workflow
---------


What are the future prospects¬†of¬†our¬†idea?
-------------------------------------------

We Aim to make our chatbot and database more Uber Like where hospital are also given some control to update the availibity of blood and then the update will dynamically updating our database.
